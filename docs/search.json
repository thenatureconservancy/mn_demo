However, due to harvests, fire suppression and other management actions (in addtion to changes in natural processes) there have been some notable changes in succession classes (see “Succession classes for most dominant Biophysical Settings”) section below:\n\nPerhaps the most interesting broad-scale change is conversion of ‘conifer’ types to ‘hardwood’, presumably due to fire suppression.\nSome ecosystems have sizable over/under-representation of successin classes on the landscape today compared to modeled historic. For example:\n\nLaurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest - Hemlock is missing succession class D\nClasses A-C under represented in the Boreal Jack Pine-Black Spruce Forest - Pine Barrens\nClass A and B under reprented in the Boreal Acidic Peatland Systems\n\n\nThese differences may or may not be ‘real’ on the ground and/or may not be a management priority."
